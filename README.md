In this third and final project we chose to make a tic tac toe web application that demonstrate these learning objectives.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack MERN application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Acomplishments:

    We were able to log in to the website and sign-in your e-mail and password to place your information in the leaderboard, the user is able to play the game with or without signing in and the developement we used React and mongodb, javascript, CSS and HTML technologies. As a group we colaborated as a professional development team would when working on a project together.

## Challenges

    *We had problems with the log-in, both front end and back end.
    *the problem with the log-in was that we needed a usename to log in but we never use username only e-mail and password.
    *Deployment to Heroku was challenging because it worked at the beginning and the it crash having to do it all over again.
